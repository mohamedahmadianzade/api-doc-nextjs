          Welcome to the Oxolo API documentation! Our API allows you to create
          high-quality videos for e-commerce products, which can increase sales,
          engagement, and traffic. With our API, you can easily integrate video
          creation into your e-commerce platform or application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our API offers a variety of routes that allow you to retrieve video
          information, check the status of videos, and create new videos using
          different input methods, such as URLs, forms, and product information.
          You can also retrieve information about our actors, voices, templates,
          and music assets for video creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each video costs 5 credits to create, and on average takes 10 minutes
          to generate. You can edit your videos using our web-based video editor
          at studio.oxolo.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that our API documentation will help you integrate video
          creation into your e-commerce platform or application with ease. If
          you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact
          us.

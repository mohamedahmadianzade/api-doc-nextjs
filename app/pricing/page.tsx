          Our Free plan is a great way to get started with Oxolo. With this
          plan, you can generate videos for your e-commerce products without
          needing to provide a credit card. However, please note that videos
          generated with the Free plan will include a watermark.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Free plan comes with 15 credits, which can be used to create up to
          3 videos (since each video costs 5 credits). This is a great way to
          try out our service and see how it works for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sign up for the Free plan, simply visit our pricing page and select
          the Free plan. You'll be able to start generating videos right away.
          If you have any questions about the Free plan, please don't hesitate
          to contact us.
